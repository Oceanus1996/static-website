                          The Germany national football team was founded in 1900 and is one of the oldest national teams in the world. In the 1920 Antwerp Olympic football tournament, the German national team participated in the Olympic football tournament for the first time but did not win a medal.
                      <br><br> At the time, the German national team was coached by Heinrich Schmidt, and the players included Friedrich Rugge, Klaus Fischer, Robert Fedden, and George Walker, among others. Although the German national team did not win a medal at that time, they gradually rose in the subsequent matches and became one of the most successful football national teams in the world.
